            <h1> 1. Promotion of health facilities that are less than optimal</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Health promotion in Indonesia is currently still not optimal. Usually this process is carried out by medical
                    personnel by visiting residential areas or holding general education for a community. This promotion aims to
                    make every resident more aware of maintaining their health and utilizing the health facilities around them.
                    However, the lack of cooperation between health workers and the community means that promotion of these health
                    facilities often runs less than optimally and does not reach targets. There are still many people who are
                    reluctant to take the time to attend health education provided by hospitals and health centers. Most people are
                    constrained by distance and time, where they prefer to spend their time working rather than visiting hospitals
                    or health centers to attend counseling. Therefore, health facilities should think about appropriate strategies
                    so that health promotion can reach the community without having to meet face to face, for example by sending
                    digital messages and the like.</p>
            </div>
            <h1> 2. Unequal Distribution of Health Facilities</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In fact, the provision of health facilities in the form of hospitals, clinics or community health centers is
                    still dominated by the island of Java. Based on data from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia,
                    the distribution index for community health centers in Indonesia is 86.14% compared to the eastern region of
                    Indonesia which only has 4. only 41%. This is certainly not commensurate with the ratio of Indonesia's
                    population. This is also caused by unequal accessibility, connectivity and development of facilities and
                    infrastructure. Many people from remote villages have difficulty accessing health facilities, which can take
                    hours to travel from their homes. This makes them reluctant to use health facilities and prefer to use
                    traditional medicine in their village. Apart from that, the distribution of health workers such as doctors is
                    also not evenly distributed. This is proven by the fact that there are still many hospitals and health centers
                    in the Maluku and Papua regions that do not have doctors, especially specialist doctors. The main reason is the
                    inadequate accessibility and provision of health equipment at these locations, so that many doctors are
                    reluctant to serve at 3T locations. This is of course very unfortunate, considering that every citizen of the
                    Republic of Indonesia has the right to receive adequate health facilities.</p>
            </div>
            <h1>3. Inadequate Medical Devices and Medical Equipment</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Medical devices or medical equipment are important facilities and infrastructure in the process of treating,
                    healing or preventing disease for health services. The availability of medical equipment can help save many
                    human lives, from the diagnosis process to the surgical stage. However, it is very unfortunate that the
                    standardization of standard medical equipment in Indonesia is still inadequate. This is because the
                    implementation of SNI standardization is not yet very strict, so testing of medical devices still has to be
                    carried out abroad, which requires a lot of funds. Apart from that, according to the Ministry of Health of the
                    Republic of Indonesia, there are still many health facilities in Indonesia that do not trust the quality of
                    local medical equipment so that an investment ecosystem in the medical equipment business has not yet been
                    formed. The government needs to intensify its campaign to be proud to buy Indonesian products, especially
                    medical devices. Apart from this, standardization must also be implemented immediately. In this way, the program
                    for distributing adequate medical equipment can be implemented well in Indonesia.</p>
            </div>
            <h1> 4. There are still many health facilities that have not yet taken advantage of technological developments</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In this increasingly advanced era, technology is developing day by day. Almost all societal activities are
                    involved with technology, for example shopping in e-commerce, using online vehicle services, disseminating
                    information digitally, and so on. In fact, companies in various fields are competing to utilize technology to
                    improve the work rhythm of their companies so that they can continue to exist in business competition.</p>
